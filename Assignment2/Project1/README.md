To run this code, you must have the main.cpp file, and the LinkedList.h file in the same folder and the files all must be named as outlined here. Then you can open the folder in an IDE such as VS Code and run the main.cpp file. The program will then run and prompt the user for input which can be typed in the terminal, and additional instructions for each of the functions will also be presented to the user when the option is chosen.
