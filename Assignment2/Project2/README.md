# Program2

Program2 will calculate money, vacation days, and health care contributions based on professional and nonprofessional employee rules
The program will prompt the user to enter the amount of months or hours worked and will calculate and display all the information to the user

The user can type directly into the terminal with integers or dobubles and the values will be updated

These screenshots are from the terminal is VS Code and each function is tested and screenshots are posted for the functions.

To run this code, you must have the Professional.cpp file, Nonprofessional.cpp file, and the Employee.h file in the same folder and the files all must be named as outlined here. Then you can open the folder in an IDE such as VS Code and run the professional.cpp file, or nonprofessional.cpp file. The program will then run and prompt the user for input which can be typed in the terminal, and additional instructions for each of the functions will also be presented to the user when the option is chosen.
