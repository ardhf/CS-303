# Assignment1

This program will take in a text file with some numbers in it (up to 150) and then store those values in the array and give you some options.
1) Print the array
2) Find an integer within the array
3) Replace an integer within the array with another value
4) Add an integer to the end of the array
5) Remove an integer from the array
6) Exit the program

The user can type directly into the terminal any one of these integers and the correct option will be displayed or another question will prompt the user if additional input is needed.

These screenshots are from the terminal is VS Code and each method is tested and three screenshots are posted regarding the output of each of the functions in order.

To run this code, you must have the Assignment1.ccp file, the Assignment1.h file and the TextInput.txt file all in the same folder and the files all must be named as outlined here. Then you can open the folder in an IDE such as VS Code and run the Assignment1.cpp file. The program will then run and prompt the user for input which can be typed in the terminal, and additional instructions for each of the methods will also be presented to the user when the option is chosen.
